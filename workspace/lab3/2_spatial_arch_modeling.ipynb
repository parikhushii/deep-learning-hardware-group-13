    "Now that you are familiar with the basic single PE setup, letâ€™s look at an example of a full system as shown in the figure below. This design is composed of two levels of on-chip storage -- the global buffer and the local scratchpads in each PE as described in part 1. Each datatype is sent via a network from the global buffer to the PE array, and there are inter-PE networks that are capable of sending various data types within the array. We provide you with the loop nest of a matmul on this design in the figure below. \n",
