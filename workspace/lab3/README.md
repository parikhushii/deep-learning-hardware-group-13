Please run and complete all Jupyter notebooks in this lab.

## Submission
After finishing the lab, please run `make submit` in the root directory (NOT in
the Docker container. Outside the workspace directory). of your repository to
submit your code. Check your submission on the GitHub website and ensure that
all notebooks have all cells run and all outputs visible. Additionally, ensure
that the `answers.yaml` file in the website matches the answers you have in your
notebooks. If either the notebooks or the `answers.yaml` file are not up to
date, you may lose points or receive a zero for the assignment.
