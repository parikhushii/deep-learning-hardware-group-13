    "### Question 2\n",
    "Manually generating the best mapping for each architecture and layer shape is rather time-consuming, even if the search is performed under a tightly constrained map sapace, *e.g.,* the one in question 2.2. Therefore, Timeloop provides automatic mapspace search functinality when appropriate map space constriants are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform an automatic mapspace search, you need to provide mapspace constraints as an input. Mapspace constraints specify the limitations imposed by your dataflow or hardware structures. They include the same directives as the mapping, except they are an *incomplete* description of the mapping, and they allow the mapper to optimize over all unspecified parts. An example mapspace constraint is shown below (`designs/system/constraints.yaml`). To automatically search the mapspace with the constraints file, you should run the `run_timeloop_mapper` command.\n",

    "*The search should take less than 5 minutes to finish. If you are running the command from the shell instead of running the below cell, you can also terminate it whenever you want by pressing Ctrl+C (you will need to wait for Timeloop to finish the remainig computations after you send the signal; the terminated threads will have a dash next to its id).*"
