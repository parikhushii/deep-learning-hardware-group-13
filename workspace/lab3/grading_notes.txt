1.5.1 PxQ: Accept 5 or 25
1.5.1 RxS: Accept 3 or 9

1.8.6 To reduce **DRAM <==> Global Buffer** input movement, we could move loops:
    Accept if the answer is a subset of (P), (Q), (R), (S), (M) with three elements

3.3 Little's Law: A bug in the autograder would overwrite their answer with
their assumptions if assumptions were listed. You'll have to check the Jupyter
notebook to see their answer.

4.3.1: Loop below. Also accept if students have any extra indices in i, f, and
psum (i.e., [0], [3], [1]), or did the q+s math inline
    For q in range Q
    For s in range S
        w = q + s
        Psum[q] += i[w]*f[s]

1.5.2 and 1.5.3 scratchpad energy: Partial credit if they put ~16200 for both.
They forgot to add leakage energy.

1.6.1: For the numbers, students may vary because of differences in the
datawidth attributes. Be very generous if they use "log2" in the datawidth
attribute. Be strict if they don't (we told them explicitly to use log2).

3.2: Also accept if a student chose the 4x4 architecture. This will lead to
different cycles and energy results, but if they picked 4x4 then accept the
different results.
